This site uses Google Translate as a proxy to access blocked sites, as the first layer.

This should get through most firewalls.

Then, it exploits a feature of Securly, tricking it into thinking we're visiting a suicide prevention website. There's a failsafe for this, and it allowes us through.

There's probably a legal reason for this. Securly allows you to suicide prevention content, even if the parent site is blocked.

If you get an error, try again later or use a different site. Not every site works with this.

Proxy breaks a lot of stuff.
